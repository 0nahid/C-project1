// Algorithm:

1. Strat with taking units that consumed by the user
2. Assign the units to the units variable
3. Define the units costs
   - if the unit is less that 500 then the per unit cost is 8
   - if the unit is more than 500 & less then 1000, then the per unit cost is 12
   - if the unit is more than 1000 then the per unit cost is 15
4. Calculate the unit cost
5. Add sub charges on the total unit cost of 50%
6. Calculate the total cost
7. Print the total cost
